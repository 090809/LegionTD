7.10

## General Changes

- Builder Passives added!

- Elemental Builder gets stat bonuses and penalties on his entire legion depending on how much gold he's proportionally spent on each element. If he manages to get all elements within a threshhold of the average, he gets maximum stacks on all stats. Purchasing a God for an element (the most expensive upgrade for each element) will stabilize that element, making elemental harmony that much easier to achieve.

- Nature Builder gets a final death knell on each of his units, healing a nearby ally for 10% of the dying unit's maximum health and dealing as much magic damage to a nearby foe.

- New Nature Builder Unit: Treebeard. Upgrades from Treant, has Treant Protector's Overgrowth with a 2 second duration, and owning one will double the effectiveness of Nature Builder's passive.

- Human Builder gets 1.2 food per turn.

- Physical Damage Types added!

	There are 3 physical attack types: normal, pierce, and arcane; and 3 physical defense types: light, medium, and heavy. Front-line melee units are generally normal/heavy, archer-types and certain melee units are generally pierce/medium, and wizardly units are generally arcane/light.

- If more than 15 units are being sent to the same player, each additional set of 15 will be delayed by an additional 2 seconds (This should fix certain situations where send units will get stuck when a large number is sent at once, especially in playercount-imbalanced games).

- "King" (wave 20) attack time increased from .4 to .6
