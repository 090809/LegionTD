7.9b.rc1

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a case where missing players could cause round-start to fail, preventing unlocking of player units.

- Fixed a case where players could miss the tango-ticker event if they spawned late.

## Gameplay

- Human Builder Futuristic Gyrocopter Flak Cannon max attacks reduced from 3 to 2, range from 1000 to 600.

- Human Builder Footman/Soldier/Spearman Shield Bash block chance changed from 75/85/95 to 70 (block values still 4/12/16)

- Human Builder Hunter Headshot proc chance reduced from 40 to 20, damage increased from 20 to 40 (to match other archer headshots)

- Wave Bosses now have a passive magic immunity ability with a 10 second duration and 16 second cooldown (so bosses have 6 out of every 16 seconds where they aren't magic immune).

- Disconnected players will have a leak penalty equivalent to 25 units (+250% tango generation interval) until a wave starts while they are connected.
