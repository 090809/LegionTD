0.7.11b

- Each team's can only have 45 send units in their "pit" at one time. When an additional send is purchased, the weakest will be destroyed. (You still earn income for sends that are instantly destroyed in this way)

- Purchase cooldown for the first row of units has been removed. (kobold, hill troll shaman, hill troll warrior, and harpy)

- Fixed not being able to build a unit quickly in a space where a unit was sold.
