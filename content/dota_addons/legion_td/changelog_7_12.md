0.7.12

## General Changes

- The final duel now decides the game as each team's king teleports to the middle of the map to settle things once and for all.

- Setup time before duels is now less than for other rounds, 10 seconds instead of 35

- Fixed Return to Sender not working for Dire

## Builders

- Elemental Builder rework: Gods now upgrade from Elementals instead of Benders (Benders are the basic summon). Their upgrade costs have been decreased so they still have the same total gold cost, still require one additional food.
