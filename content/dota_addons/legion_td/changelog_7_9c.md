0.7.9c

## Gameplay

- Wave Bosses have double their previous attack times (fatty .8 to 1.6, king and dragon .4 to .8)

- Wave Bosses now passively recieve +100 attack speed
	
	(Just like roshan in 6.86, this will mean their normal attack speed is the same, but they're more resilient to attack slows)

- Human Builder Upgrade Footman Gold Cost increased from 65 to 70.

- Human Builder Hunter Headshot proc chance reduced from 40% to 20%, damage increased from 20 to 40 (same damage as other headshots).

- Fixed Human Builder Gunner not having an improved attack time (now .6 instead of 1.6).

## Misc/Cosmetic

- Updated some Human Builder Archer and Mage units with different cosmetics (Archer, Hunter, Marksman, Novice, Mage, Archmage, Icewrack Grandmaster).

- Fixed a few cosmetic "stretch marks" on the map.

- Added and updated a few English strings.
